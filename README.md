# ThesisWebsite
A website combining API Documentation with a dependency graph, developed for my bachelor thesis

Read the Readme.pdf for more information

The website uses the javascript library dagre-d3 to render graphs, it needs to be installed to host this website and can be found here:
[https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre-d3](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre-d3)

This is only a proof-of-concept for my thesis idea, but I am currently working on building a more usable flutter website which might include User-Accounts, projects on which a team of users can work together, editing graphs on the website without downloading them first and the combination of multiple OpenAPI files
